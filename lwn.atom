      The &lt;a href=&quot;https://lwn.net/Articles/723421/&quot;&gt;4.12-rc2&lt;/a&gt; kernel prepatch is out.
&quot;&lt;span&gt;I'm back on the usual Sunday schedule, and everything else looks
fairly normal too. This rc2 is maybe a bit bigger than usual, but the
whole merge window was bigger than most, so maybe it's just that. And
it's not like it's huge&lt;/span&gt;&quot;.

      Back in 2014, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://lwn.net/Articles/627419/&quot;&gt;revelation&lt;/a&gt; that the
kernel's
memory-management subsystem would not allow relatively small allocation
requests to fail created a bit of a stir.  The discussion has settled down
since then, but the &quot;too small to fail&quot; rule still clearly creates a
certain amount of confusion in the kernel community, as is evidenced by a
recent discussion inspired by the 4.12 merge window.  It would appear that
the rule remains in effect, but developers are asked to act as if it did not.

      The CoreOS Blog &lt;a
href=&quot;https://coreos.com/blog/introducing-zetcd&quot;&gt;introduces&lt;/a&gt; the first
beta release, v0.0.1, of zetcd.  &quot;&lt;span&gt;Distributed systems commonly rely
on a distributed consensus to coordinate work. Usually the systems
providing distributed consensus guarantee information is delivered in order
and never suffer split-brain conflicts. The usefulness, but rich design
space, of such systems is evident by the proliferation of implementations;
projects such as &lt;a
href=&quot;https://research.google.com/archive/chubby.html&quot;&gt;chubby&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a 
href=&quot;https://zookeeper.apache.org/&quot;&gt;ZooKeeper&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a
href=&quot;https://github.com/coreos/etcd&quot;&gt;etcd&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a
href=&quot;https://www.consul.io/&quot;&gt;consul&lt;/a&gt;, despite differing in philosophy
and protocol, all focus on serving similar basic key-value primitives for
distributed consensus. As part of making etcd the most appealing foundation
for distributed systems, the etcd team developed a new proxy, zetcd, to
serve ZooKeeper requests with an unmodified etcd cluster.&lt;/span&gt;&quot;

      <title>[$] The trouble with SMC-R</title>

      Among &lt;a href=&quot;https://lwn.net/Articles/715161/&quot;&gt;the many features merged for the 4.11
kernel&lt;/a&gt; was the &quot;shared memory communications over RDMA&quot; (SMC-R)
protocol from IBM.  SMC-R is a
high-speed data-center communications protocol that is claimed to be much
more efficient than basic TCP sockets.  As it turns 
out, though, the merging of this code was a surprise — and an unpleasant
one at that — to a relevant segment of the kernel development community.
This issue and the difficulties in resolving it are an indicator of how the
increasingly fast-paced kernel development community can go off track.

      On April 29, Al Viro &lt;a
href=&quot;https://lwn.net/Articles/721443/&quot;&gt;posted a
patch&lt;/a&gt; on the linux-api mailing list adding a new flag to be used in
conjunction with the &lt;tt&gt;...at()&lt;/tt&gt; family of system calls. The flag is for
containing pathname resolution to the same filesystem and subtree as
the given starting point. This is a useful feature to have for
implementing file I/O in programs that accept pathnames as untrusted user
input.  The ensuing discussion made it clear that there were multiple use
cases for such a feature, especially if the granularity of its restrictions
could be increased.

      &lt;p&gt;In November 2016, a new networking feature, IPv6 segment
routing (also known as &quot;IPv6 SR&quot; or &quot;SRv6&quot;), was &lt;a
href=&quot;https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/davem/net-next.git/commit/
?id=5db5b395150186d4a177ebfa563894af302ab3ad&quot;&gt;merged&lt;/a&gt; into net-next and
subsequently included in Linux 4.10. In
this article, we explain this new feature, describe key elements of its
implementation, and present a few performance measurements.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>
      A virulent ransomware worm attacked a wide swath of Windows
machines worldwide in mid-May.  The malware, known as Wcry, Wanna, or
WannaCry, infected a number of systems at high-profile organizations as
well as striking at critical pieces of the infrastructure—like hospitals, banks,
and train stations.  While the threat seems to have largely abated—for
now—the origin of some of its code, which is apparently the US National Security
Agency (NSA), should give one pause.

      For some years now, your editor has heard glowing reviews of &lt;a
href=&quot;https://mosh.org/&quot;&gt;Mosh&lt;/a&gt; — the &quot;mobile shell&quot; — as a replacement
for SSH.  The Mosh developers make a number of claims about its
reconnection ability, performance, and security; at least some of those are
relatively easily testable.  After a bit of moshing, a few clear
conclusions have come to the fore.
